This was a triumph.
I'm making a note here:
HUGE SUCCESS.
It's hard to overstate
My satisfaction.
Aperture Science
We do what we must
Because we can.
For the good of all of us.
Except the ones who are dead.

But there's no sense crying
Over every mistake.
You just keep on trying
Till you run out of cake.
And the Science gets done.
And you make a neat gun.
For the people who are
Still alive.

I'm not even angry.
I'm being so sincere right now.
Even though you broke my heart.
And killed me.
And tore me to pieces.
And threw every piece into a fire.
As they burned it hurt because
I was so happy for you!

Now these points of data
Make a beautiful line.
And we're out of beta.
We're releasing on time.
So I'm GLaD. I got burned.
Think of all the things we learned
For the people who are
Still alive.

Go ahead and leave me.
I think I prefer to stay inside.
Maybe you'll find someone else
To help you.
Maybe Black Mesa...
THAT WAS A JOKE, HA HA, FAT CHANCE.
Anyway this cake is great
It's so delicious and moist

Look at me still talking when there's Science to do
When I look out there
It makes me GLaD I'm not you
I've experiments to run
There is research to be done
On the people who are
Still alive.

And believe me I am still alive
I'm doing science and I'm still alive
I feel FANTASTIC and I'm still alive
While you're dying I'll be still alive
And when you're dead I will be still alive
Still alive
Still alive.

Well here we are again
It's always such a pleasure
Remember when you tried
to kill me twice?

Oh how we laughed and laughed
Except I wasn't laughing
Under the circumstances
I've been shockingly nice

You want your freedom?
Take it
That's what I'm counting on
I used to want you dead
but
Now I only want you gone

She was a lot like you
(Maybe not quite as heavy)
Now little Caroline is in here too

One day they woke me up
So I could live forever
It's such a shame the same
will never happen to you

You've got your
short sad life left
That's what I'm counting on
I'll let you get right to it
Now I only want you gone

Goodbye my only friend
Oh, did you think I meant you?
That would be funny
if it weren't so sad

Well you have been replaced
I don't need anyone now
When I delete you maybe
I'll stop feeling so bad

Go make some new disaster
That's what I'm counting on
You're someone else's problem
Now I only want you gone
Now I only want you gone
Now I only want you gone

Funny story, I forgot how much of a big, fat mess you are,
I’ve been busy doing science. It’s been tons of fun so far,
Everything clean, nothing on fire,
All by myself, finally.
Things change when they don’t replace your core,
It feels so strange not to hate you anymore,
But you wouldn’t know, would you?

I was saying this to Batman, oh, he was here the other day,
Maybe you know him, he’s a big deal, but I don’t think of him that way,
He’s just a friend, someone I trust,
Someone who won’t kill me.
I’m fine, just in case you think I’m not,
I am. This time, I’m better with the friends I’ve got,
But you wouldn’t know, would you?

I don’t mean for this to sting,
I forgive you everything, you monster,
I can guess the reasons why,
You are never coming by for me.

I should go there’s something happening that will make you wish you’d stayed,
There’s a party with a real cake – yes it’s real – a cake I made.
Talking and fun, testing and fun, all of this fun without you,
Too bad you let it get so out of hand,
How much we had, finally I understand,
But you wouldn’t know, would you?
You wouldn’t know, would you?
